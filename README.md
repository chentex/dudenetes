The *most relaxed* testing framework of Kubernetes in the world

## Dudelopers abide!

Come join the most relaxed testing framework of Kubernetes in the world – **Dudenetes**. If you’d like to find continuous *peace on Github* and enjoy *bowling in production*, man, we’ll help you get started. Right after a little nap.

You shouldn’t try *too hard* to enjoy working with Kubernetes. Enjoying working with Kubernetes is relatively *easy* if you just **take it easy** and **scale with the flow**. It’s not all about sprints, achievements and success. It’s about applying basic common sense, speaking English for telling stories, and not being worried about how other creeps roll at you. After all, *well, it’s just their opinion, man*.

The beauty of Dudenetes framework is its simplicity. 

> Once you write code for testing code, it gets too complex and everything can go wrong.

The alternative (Kubernetes e2e testing framework) is hard and complicated and nobody knows what to do about it. So don’t do anything about it. **Just take it easy, man**. Kick back with some friends and oat soda and if the goddamn control-plane crashes into the mountain, just **mark it zero** and don’t go **over the line** – that is to say, **abide**. And then, when nobody’s calling, let’s go find some good burgers, dude. 

Take that hill and be a good fellow **dudeloper**! That means sharing your stories and use [godog](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/godog) to map them with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) commands.

See you further on up the trail,
Thankie

## Where's the documentation, Lebowski?

It's uh... uh... it's down there somewhere, let me take another look. Does this look to you as a proper repository to you, man? Does this place look like certified? The toilet seat's up man!
Just be patient and don't unirinate on the rug.

But! You can find a nice tutorial at our [Dudewiki](https://github.com/drpaneas/dudenetes/wiki).

### What is Godog, dude?

Obviously, you are not a gopher! Package `godog` is the **official Cucumber** open source behavior-driven development framework for Go.

### What is kubectl, dude?

Are you *8-years* old or what?

### What is this?

The combination of `godog` and `kubectl`. People who are using this project they are called **Dudelopers**

#### Star us on Github

There's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark out, and we're wearing sunglasses. Hit it!
